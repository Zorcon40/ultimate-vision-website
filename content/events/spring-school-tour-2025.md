Join Clark Roberts on his Spring 2025 School Tour across the Pacific Northwest! Clark will be visiting elementary and middle schools to deliver his inspiring Kids EDGE program, teaching students about kindness, compassion, and inclusion.

Each presentation includes interactive activities, a meet-and-greet with Clark's guide dog Luna, and a Q&A session where students can ask Clark about his experiences navigating life without sight.

Schools interested in hosting a presentation can contact us to schedule a visit. Space is limited, so book early!
